;; Copyright (C) 2026 Elle Najt

;; Author: Elle Najt
;; URL: https://github.com/ElleNajt/agent-shell-to-go
;; Version: 0.2.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1") (agent-shell "0.33.1") (websocket "1.14"))
;; Keywords: convenience, tools, ai

;; This file is not part of GNU Emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; agent-shell-to-go mirrors your agent-shell conversations to Slack,
;; letting you interact with your AI agents from your phone or any device.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Each agent-shell session gets its own Slack thread
;; - Messages you send from Emacs appear in Slack
;; - Messages you send from Slack get injected back into agent-shell
;; - Real-time via Slack Socket Mode (WebSocket)
;; - Works with any agent-shell agent (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
;;
;; Quick start:
;;    (use-package agent-shell-to-go
;;      :after agent-shell
;;      :config
;;      (setq agent-shell-to-go-bot-token "xoxb-...")
;;      (setq agent-shell-to-go-channel-id "C...")
;;      (setq agent-shell-to-go-app-token "xapp-...")
;;      (setq agent-shell-to-go-authorized-users '("U..."))  ; REQUIRED
;;      (agent-shell-to-go-setup))
;;
;; See README.md for full setup instructions including:
;; - Slack app creation (with manifest for quick setup)
;; - Secure credential storage (pass, macOS Keychain)
;; - Security configuration (authorized users allowlist)
